# Python-Programming-Course-Code
The Intermediate Python codes presented here in were collaboratively developed by myself and colleagues—Alejandro Boyco, Stephy Riega, and Gabriela Vidal—as part of our coursework for the Diploma of Specialization in Data Science for Social Sciences and Public Policy at PUCP.
On the other hand, the basic Python codes were developed by myself and colleagues-Andrea Clavo, Mariana Otero and Valeria Lévano- as part of the initial coursework form the Diploma.
